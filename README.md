# Benign-vs-Malignant

This project aims to distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions using a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based machine learning approach for skin cancer detection.

## Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Early and accurate detection is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project leverages SVM, a robust classification algorithm, to analyze features extracted from skin lesion images or datasets and predict whether a lesion is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

## Workflow

- **Data Collection:** Gather a dataset of labeled skin lesion images or features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, normalize, and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from the images (e.g., color, texture, shape).
- **Model Training:** Train an SVM classifier on the processed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to classify new, unseen skin lesion data.

## Objective

The primary objective is to build a reliable and accurate tool that can assist healthcare professionals in distinguishing between benign and malignant skin lesions, thereby supporting early diagnosis and treatment
